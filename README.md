:construction: Still work in progress...

The RPC (Resource Pack Converter) is a npm package which can convert a Minecraft: Java Edition resource pack from any version to another version.

## Usage

You can use it via the official website or importing it to your project.

### Use it Online

Open [the official website](https://rpc.spgoding.com).

IT'S NOT AVALIABLE ACTUALLY.

### Import it to your Project

0. Installation.
    ```Bash
    npm i resource-pack-converter
    ```
1. Import.
    ```TypeScript
    import { convert } from 'resource-pack-converter'
    ```
2. *TODO*

## File Structure

- `src`: Source code written in TypeScript.
- `lib`: Output JavaScript files.
- `uti`: Some useful tools while coding.
    - `analyzer.js`: Generates a *conversion* of `./uti/input/A/` into `./uti/input/B/`.

## How does it Work

### Overview

The RPC will duplicate the input resource pack at first, and then execute all *adapters* orderly for each file in the duplicated resource pack according to specific *conversion*.

### Adapters

*Adapters* carry out operations for specific files in the resource pack, e.g. renaming files, scaling images, changing text contents, etc. All adapters are written in TypeScript and should implement the `Adapter` interface. They are located in `./src/adapters/`.

Adapters may be referenced and initialized by *conversions*.

Here are all built-in adapters.

- [RenameAdapter](#RenameAdapter)

#### RenameAdapter

Rename the input file according to `operations`.

- `operations`: (Required) Array. Stores all renaming operations.
    - An object.
        - `find`: (Required) String. Specifies the files which this operation should handle. Should be an Regular Expression.
        - `rename`: (Required) String. Specifies the new file name.

e.g.

```JSON
{
    "operations": [
        {
            "find": "assets/minecraft/textures/block/foo\\.png(\\.mcmeta)?", 
            "rename": "bar\\.png$1"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Conversions

A *Conversion* contains a set of adapters. It's JSON formatted and stored in `./src/conversions/`.

- The root tag.
    - `adapters`: (Required) Array. Initialize adapters here.
        - An object. Represents an adapter.
            - `id`: (Required) String. The identity of adapter.
            - `params`: (Optional) Object. Stores all parameters used to initialize the adapter.
                - *`key`*: Value.
    - `from`: (Required) String. Specifies the game version which the conversion starts from.
    - `to`: (Required) String. Specifies the game version which the conversion ends with.

## Contributing

I'm thrilled to hear that you'd like to contribute to this project. It's no doubt that the converter will be better with your help!

1.  Fork this this repo and clone it to your local.

2.  Install dependencies.

    `npm i`

3.  Edit files in `./src`.

4.  If you add new features, it's strongly recommend to write tests for them. All tests should be put under `./src/test`.

5.  Commit your changes by `npm run commit` and then push them to the origin.

6.  Open a Pull Request. The circle CI will build and test your changes automatically.

There must be lots of mistakes and bad practice in this repository. If you find something not good or not sure whether it's not good, please don't hesitate to tell me!
